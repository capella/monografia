\chapter{Improving SMART}

The opemMSP430 memory backbone is changed, allowing writing in the program memory.  This change makes possible remote device updates, but also introduces several security breaches.  However, the SMART implementation can identify if any breach occurs.

A system is built to control, verify and make a remote update using the SMART as the final example.

The article \textit{ASSURED: Architecture for Secure Software Update of Realistic Embedded Devices}\cite{assured} has the base of this system.
